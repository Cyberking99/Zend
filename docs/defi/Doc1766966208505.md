# ProjectName - Technical Documentation Overview

## Introduction
ProjectName is a decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol built on the Ethereum blockchain designed to enable trustless, transparent, and permissionless financial services. It facilitates lending, borrowing, and yield farming through smart contracts, eliminating intermediaries and reducing costs.

## Architecture
- **Smart Contracts:** Written in Solidity, deployed on Ethereum Mainnet. Core contracts include:
  - **LendingPool:** Manages deposits and loans.
  - **YieldOptimizer:** Automates yield farming strategies.
  - **Governance:** Enables token-holder voting on protocol upgrades.

- **Frontend:** React-based web application interacting with smart contracts via Web3.js/Ethers.js.

- **Oracles:** Chainlink oracles provide real-time price feeds to ensure accurate collateral valuation.

## Key Features
- **Collateralized Lending:** Users can deposit assets as collateral to borrow other tokens.
- **Interest Rates:** Dynamic rates determined algorithmically based on supply and demand.
- **Yield Farming:** Users can stake tokens to earn rewards, with automated strategy optimization.
- **Governance Token:** Native token used for voting on proposals and protocol parameters.

## Security
- Audited by reputable third-party firms.
- Implements reentrancy guards, input validation, and upgradeable contract patterns.
- Uses OpenZeppelin libraries for standard secure contract components.

## Getting Started
1. Connect your Web3 wallet (e.g., MetaMask) to the Ethereum Mainnet.
2.
