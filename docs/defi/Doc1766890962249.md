# ProjectName - Technical Documentation Note

## Overview
ProjectName is a decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol built on the Ethereum blockchain, designed to provide secure, transparent, and permissionless financial services. It enables users to lend, borrow, and earn interest on digital assets without intermediaries.

## Key Features
- **Lending & Borrowing:** Users can deposit supported tokens as collateral to borrow other assets with algorithmically determined interest rates.
- **Yield Farming:** Stake liquidity provider (LP) tokens to earn additional rewards in ProjectName’s native governance token.
- **Governance:** Token holders can propose and vote on protocol upgrades and parameter changes via a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO).
- **Security:** Utilizes audited smart contracts with multi-sig wallet administration and bug bounty programs to minimize risks.

## Architecture
- **Smart Contracts:** Written in Solidity, deployed on Ethereum Mainnet. Core contracts include:
  - `LendingPool.sol`: Manages deposits, withdrawals, and loans.
  - `YieldFarm.sol`: Handles staking and reward distribution.
  - `Governance.sol`: Facilitates proposals and voting.
- **Oracles:** Integrates Chainlink price feeds for real-time asset valuation.
- **Frontend:** React-based web application interacting with smart contracts via Web3.js.

## Getting Started
1. Connect your Ethereum wallet (e.g., MetaMask) to the ProjectName dApp.
2. Deposit supported tokens into the lending pool.
3. Borrow assets or stake
