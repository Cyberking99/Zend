# ProjectName - Technical Overview

## Introduction
ProjectName is a decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol built on the Ethereum blockchain, designed to enable trustless lending, borrowing, and yield farming. It leverages smart contracts to automate financial operations without intermediaries, ensuring transparency, security, and composability within the DeFi ecosystem.

## Architecture
- **Smart Contracts:** Written in Solidity, deployed on Ethereum mainnet. Core contracts include:
  - **LendingPool:** Manages deposits, loans, and interest accrual.
  - **YieldFarm:** Distributes rewards to liquidity providers based on staking.
  - **Governance:** Enables token holders to propose and vote on protocol upgrades.
- **Token Standards:** Utilizes ERC-20 for governance and reward tokens, and ERC-721 for unique collateralized assets.
- **Oracles:** Integrates Chainlink oracles for real-time price feeds to ensure accurate collateral valuation.

## Key Features
- **Overcollateralized Loans:** Users deposit assets as collateral to borrow other tokens, maintaining protocol solvency.
- **Interest Rate Model:** Dynamic rates based on supply and demand, incentivizing liquidity provision.
- **Liquidity Mining:** Users earn governance tokens by staking assets, promoting active participation.
- **Governance:** Decentralized decision-making mechanism allowing community-driven protocol evolution.

## Security
- Audited by reputable third-party firms.
- Implements upgradeable proxy patterns for contract improvements.
- Includes safety checks such as liquidation mechanisms and collateral
