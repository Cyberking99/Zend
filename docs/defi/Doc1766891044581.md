# Project: DeFiX Protocol

## Overview
DeFiX Protocol is a decentralized finance (DeFi) platform built on the Ethereum blockchain, designed to facilitate trustless lending, borrowing, and yield farming. By leveraging smart contracts, DeFiX eliminates intermediaries, enabling users to earn interest on deposits or obtain loans with collateral securely and transparently.

## Key Features
- **Lending & Borrowing:** Users can deposit supported ERC-20 tokens to earn interest or borrow assets by providing collateral.
- **Yield Farming:** Stake liquidity provider (LP) tokens to earn additional DeFiX governance tokens as rewards.
- **Governance:** Token holders can participate in protocol governance by proposing and voting on protocol upgrades and parameter adjustments.
- **Security:** Audited smart contracts with multi-signature administrative controls ensure robust security.

## Architecture
- **Smart Contracts:** Written in Solidity, deployed on Ethereum mainnet.
- **Oracle Integration:** Price feeds sourced from Chainlink oracles to maintain accurate asset valuations.
- **Frontend:** React-based web interface interacting with smart contracts via Web3.js.

## Getting Started
1. Connect your Ethereum-compatible wallet (e.g., MetaMask).
2. Deposit supported tokens into the lending pool.
3. Borrow assets by locking collateral above the required collateralization ratio.
4. Stake LP tokens to participate in yield farming.
5. Vote on governance proposals using DeFiX tokens.

## Security Considerations
- Always verify contract addresses before interacting.
- Maintain
