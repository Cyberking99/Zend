# ProjectName - Technical Documentation Overview

## Introduction
ProjectName is a decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol built on the Ethereum blockchain designed to enable trustless, permissionless lending and borrowing of digital assets. By leveraging smart contracts, ProjectName eliminates intermediaries, reduces costs, and increases transparency for users.

## Architecture
- **Smart Contracts:** Written in Solidity, deployed on Ethereum mainnet. Core contracts include:
  - **LendingPool:** Manages deposits, loans, and interest accrual.
  - **TokenGateway:** Handles wrapped asset deposits and withdrawals.
  - **PriceOracle:** Provides real-time asset price feeds via Chainlink integration.
- **Frontend:** React-based web app interacting with contracts through Web3.js.
- **Backend:** Node.js service for off-chain analytics and notifications.

## Key Features
- **Collateralized Loans:** Users deposit crypto assets as collateral to borrow other tokens.
- **Interest Rates:** Dynamic rates determined algorithmically based on supply and demand.
- **Liquidation Mechanism:** Automatic liquidation of under-collateralized positions to maintain protocol solvency.
- **Governance:** Token holders can propose and vote on protocol upgrades.

## Security
- Contracts undergo rigorous audits by third-party firms.
- Implements OpenZeppelin libraries for secure contract patterns.
- Multi-signature wallets control critical contract upgrades.

## Getting Started
- Connect a Web3 wallet (e.g., MetaMask) to the frontend.
- Deposit supported collateral tokens into the LendingPool
