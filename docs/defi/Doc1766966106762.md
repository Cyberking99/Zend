# ProjectName - Technical Documentation Overview

## Introduction
ProjectName is a decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol built on the Ethereum blockchain that enables users to lend, borrow, and earn interest on crypto assets in a trustless and permissionless manner. The platform leverages smart contracts to automate financial operations without intermediaries, ensuring transparency, security, and composability.

## Architecture

### Smart Contracts
- **LendingPool**: Core contract managing deposits, withdrawals, and loan issuance.
- **InterestRateModel**: Dynamically adjusts interest rates based on supply and demand.
- **CollateralManager**: Handles collateral deposits, liquidation processes, and health factor calculations.
- **Governance**: Enables token holders to propose and vote on protocol upgrades.

### Token Standards
- **ERC-20**: Utilized for the native governance token and interest-bearing tokens representing user deposits.
- **ERC-721 / ERC-1155 (optional)**: Support for NFT collateral integration.

## Key Features
- **Overcollateralized Loans**: Users must deposit collateral exceeding their loan value to mitigate default risk.
- **Dynamic Interest Rates**: Rates adjust algorithmically based on asset utilization.
- **Flash Loans**: Instant, uncollateralized loans that must be repaid within a single transaction.
- **Governance**: Community-driven protocol evolution through decentralized voting.

## Security
- Audited by leading blockchain security firms.
- Implements reentrancy guards, input validation, and strict
