# ProjectName - Technical Documentation Overview

## Introduction
ProjectName is a decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol built on the Ethereum blockchain, designed to provide secure, transparent, and permissionless financial services. It enables users to lend, borrow, and earn yield on their crypto assets without intermediaries.

## Architecture
- **Smart Contracts:** Written in Solidity, deployed on Ethereum mainnet.
- **Core Modules:**
  - **Lending Pool:** Facilitates asset deposits and loans.
  - **Interest Rate Model:** Dynamic algorithm adjusting rates based on supply and demand.
  - **Collateral Management:** Ensures loan security via over-collateralization.
- **Frontend:** React-based dApp interfacing with smart contracts via Web3.js/Ethers.js.
- **Oracles:** Price feeds integrated through Chainlink for real-time asset valuation.

## Key Features
- **Permissionless Access:** Anyone with an Ethereum wallet can participate.
- **Over-collateralized Loans:** Minimizes default risk.
- **Yield Farming:** Users can stake tokens to earn rewards.
- **Governance:** Token holders vote on protocol upgrades and parameter changes.

## Security
- Smart contracts undergo regular third-party audits.
- Implements pausability and upgradeability patterns for risk mitigation.
- Uses OpenZeppelin libraries for standardized, secure contract components.

## Getting Started
1. Connect your Ethereum wallet (e.g., MetaMask) to the dApp.
2. Deposit supported ERC-20 tokens into the lending
