# Project Name: DeFiX Protocol

## Overview
DeFiX Protocol is a decentralized finance (DeFi) platform built on the Ethereum blockchain, designed to provide users with seamless access to lending, borrowing, and yield farming services. Leveraging smart contracts, DeFiX ensures trustless, transparent, and permissionless financial interactions without intermediaries.

## Key Features
- **Lending & Borrowing:** Users can supply assets to earn interest or borrow against collateral with dynamic interest rates determined by market supply and demand.
- **Yield Farming:** Stake tokens in various liquidity pools to earn rewards in the native DeFiX token.
- **Governance:** Token holders participate in protocol governance by proposing and voting on protocol upgrades and parameter changes.
- **Security:** Audited smart contracts with multi-layer security protocols to safeguard user funds.

## Architecture
- **Smart Contracts:** Written in Solidity, deployed on Ethereum mainnet.
- **Frontend:** React.js application interacting with smart contracts via Web3.js.
- **Oracle Integration:** Price feeds provided by Chainlink oracles to ensure accurate asset valuations.
- **Token Standard:** ERC-20 compliant native token (DeFiX) for governance and rewards.
