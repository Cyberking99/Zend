# ProjectName - Technical Documentation Overview

## Introduction
ProjectName is a decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol designed to enable trustless, permissionless financial services on the blockchain. Built on the Ethereum network, it facilitates lending, borrowing, and yield farming through smart contracts, ensuring transparency, security, and composability.

## Architecture
- **Smart Contracts:** Written in Solidity, the core contracts handle asset management, interest calculations, and collateralization.
- **Oracle Integration:** Price feeds are sourced from Chainlink oracles to maintain accurate asset valuations.
- **Governance:** Token holders participate in protocol upgrades via on-chain governance mechanisms.
- **Frontend:** A React-based web interface interacts with smart contracts through Web3.js/Ethers.js.

## Key Features
- **Lending & Borrowing:** Users can supply assets to earn interest or borrow against collateral.
- **Yield Farming:** Incentivizes liquidity provision with native token rewards.
- **Collateral Management:** Supports multiple asset types with dynamic collateralization ratios.
- **Security:** Audited contracts with multi-signature admin controls and bug bounty programs.

## Deployment
- **Network:** Ethereum Mainnet (also supports testnets like Ropsten, Kovan)
- **Contract Addresses:** [List of deployed contract addresses]
- **Interfacing:** Compatible with standard wallets such as MetaMask.

## Getting Started
1. Connect your wallet to the ProjectName frontend.
2. Deposit supported assets to start lending or use as collateral.
