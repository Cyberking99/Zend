# ProjectName - Technical Documentation Overview

## Introduction
ProjectName is a decentralized finance (DeFi) platform built on the Ethereum blockchain, designed to provide users with secure, permissionless access to lending, borrowing, and yield farming services. The protocol leverages smart contracts to automate financial operations without intermediaries, ensuring transparency and trustlessness.

  - **Governance:** Enables token holders to propose and vote on protocol upgrades.
- **Frontend:** React-based web application interacting with smart contracts via Web3.js.
- **Oracle Integration:** Price feeds sourced from Chainlink to ensure accurate asset valuations.

## Key Features
- **Collateralized Loans:** Users can deposit supported assets as collateral to borrow other tokens.
- **Interest Accrual:** Dynamic interest rates based on supply and demand.
- **Liquidity Mining:** Incentivizes users to provide liquidity by rewarding native tokens.
- **Governance Token:** Empowers community-driven decision making.
