# ProjectName - Technical Documentation Overview

## Introduction
ProjectName is a decentralized finance (DeFi) platform built on the Ethereum blockchain, designed to provide users with secure, transparent, and permissionless financial services. The platform enables lending, borrowing, and yield farming through smart contracts, eliminating intermediaries and reducing costs.

## Architecture
- **Blockchain:** Ethereum (ERC-20 compatible)
- **Smart Contracts:** Written in Solidity, deployed via Truffle framework
- **Frontend:** React.js with Web3.js integration for wallet connectivity
- **Oracles:** Chainlink for reliable off-chain data feeds

## Core Components
1. **Lending Pool Contract:** Manages user deposits, calculates interest rates dynamically based on supply and demand, and handles withdrawals.
2. **Borrowing Contract:** Allows users to borrow assets by providing collateral, enforces liquidation rules to maintain system solvency.
3. **Yield Farming Module:** Distributes governance tokens as rewards to liquidity providers, incentivizing participation.
4. **Governance Contract:** Enables token holders to propose and vote on protocol upgrades and parameter changes.

## Security Measures
- Comprehensive unit and integration tests covering >90% of smart contract code.
- Audited by reputable third-party security firms.
- Use of OpenZeppelin libraries for standard, battle-tested contract components.
- Timelocks on governance actions to prevent immediate protocol changes.

## Getting Started
- Connect your Ethereum wallet (e.g., MetaMask) to the ProjectName dApp
