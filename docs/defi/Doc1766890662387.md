# ProjectName - Technical Documentation Overview

## Introduction
ProjectName is a decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol built on the Ethereum blockchain designed to enable secure, transparent, and permissionless financial services. It facilitates lending, borrowing, and yield farming through smart contracts, eliminating intermediaries and reducing costs.

## Architecture
- **Blockchain:** Ethereum (EVM-compatible)
- **Smart Contracts:** Written in Solidity, deployed via Truffle/Hardhat
- **Frontend:** React.js with Web3.js/Ethers.js for blockchain interaction
- **Oracles:** Chainlink for reliable off-chain data feeds

## Core Components
1. **Lending Pool Contract:** Manages user deposits and loans, calculates interest rates algorithmically based on supply and demand.
2. **Yield Farming Contract:** Allows users to stake tokens and earn rewards in the native ProjectName token.
3. **Governance Contract:** Enables token holders to propose and vote on protocol upgrades and parameter changes.
4. **Token Contract:** ERC-20 compliant native token used for governance and incentivization.

## Security
- Smart contracts are audited by third-party firms.
- Implements reentrancy guards and input validation to prevent common vulnerabilities.
- Uses OpenZeppelin libraries for standardized, secure contract templates.

## Integration
- Compatible with major wallets like MetaMask, WalletConnect.
- Supports integration with DeFi aggregators and analytics platforms via subgraph APIs.

## Usage
Users interact with the protocol by connecting their wallets to the frontend interface
