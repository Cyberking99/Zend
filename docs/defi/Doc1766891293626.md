# Project Name: DeFiX Protocol

## Overview
DeFiX Protocol is a decentralized finance (DeFi) platform built on the Ethereum blockchain, designed to provide users with seamless access to lending, borrowing, and yield farming services. Leveraging smart contracts, DeFiX ensures trustless, transparent, and permissionless financial interactions without intermediaries.

## Key Features
- **Lending & Borrowing:** Users can supply assets to earn interest or borrow against collateral with dynamic interest rates determined by market supply and demand.
- **Yield Farming:** Stake supported tokens in liquidity pools to earn additional rewards in the form of DeFiX governance tokens.
- **Governance:** Token holders can participate in protocol governance by proposing and voting on upgrades, parameter changes, and new asset listings.
- **Security:** Audited smart contracts with multi-layered security mechanisms to prevent common vulnerabilities and exploits.

## Architecture
- **Smart Contracts:** Written in Solidity, deployed on Ethereum mainnet.
- **Oracle Integration:** Price feeds from Chainlink oracles ensure accurate asset valuations.
- **Frontend:** React-based web application interacting with smart contracts via Web3.js or Ethers.js.
- **Wallet Support:** Compatible with MetaMask, WalletConnect, and other Ethereum wallets.

## Getting Started
