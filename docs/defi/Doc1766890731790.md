# ProjectName - Technical Documentation Overview

## Introduction
ProjectName is a decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol built on the Ethereum blockchain designed to enable trustless, permissionless financial services. It provides users with secure and transparent access to lending, borrowing, and yield farming functionalities through smart contracts.

## Architecture
- **Blockchain:** Ethereum (EVM-compatible)
- **Smart Contracts:** Written in Solidity, deployed via Truffle/Hardhat
- **Frontend:** React.js with Web3.js/Ethers.js integration
- **Oracles:** Chainlink for reliable off-chain data feeds

## Core Components
1. **Lending Pool Contract**
   - Allows users to deposit assets as collateral.
   - Facilitates borrowing against collateral with dynamic interest rates.
   - Implements liquidation mechanisms to maintain protocol solvency.

2. **Yield Farming Module**
   - Users can stake LP tokens to earn governance tokens.
   - Rewards distribution is handled via automated smart contract logic.

3. **Governance Contract**
   - Token holders can propose and vote on protocol upgrades.
   - Implements timelocks and multisig for secure governance execution.

## Security Features
- Comprehensive unit and integration tests.
- Audited by third-party security firms.
- Implements reentrancy guards, input validation, and access control modifiers.

## Interaction Flow
1. User connects wallet via MetaMask or similar.
2. User deposits assets into the lending pool.
3. User can borrow assets up to a collateralization ratio.
