# ProjectName - Technical Documentation Overview

## Introduction
ProjectName is a decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol built on the Ethereum blockchain designed to enable trustless, permissionless, and transparent financial services. It leverages smart contracts to facilitate lending, borrowing, and yield farming without intermediaries.

## Architecture
- **Smart Contracts:** Written in Solidity, deployed on Ethereum mainnet. Core contracts include:
  - **LendingPool:** Manages deposits and loans.
  - **YieldFarm:** Distributes rewards to liquidity providers.
  - **Governance:** Enables token holders to propose and vote on protocol upgrades.
- **Frontend:** React-based dApp interfacing with smart contracts via Web3.js/Ethers.js.
- **Oracles:** Chainlink oracles provide reliable price feeds for collateral valuation.

## Key Features
- **Collateralized Lending:** Users deposit supported crypto assets as collateral to borrow other assets.
- **Interest Rates:** Dynamic rates determined algorithmically based on supply and demand.
- **Liquidation Mechanism:** Positions below collateral thresholds are liquidated to maintain protocol solvency.
- **Governance Token:** Enables decentralized decision-making and protocol parameter adjustments.

## Security
- Audited by reputable third-party firms.
- Implements reentrancy guards and input validation.
- Uses OpenZeppelin libraries for standardized contract components.

## Getting Started
- Connect wallet (MetaMask, WalletConnect).
- Deposit assets into LendingPool.
- Borrow assets or stake tokens in YieldFarm.
