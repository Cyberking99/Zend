## Key Features
- **Collateralized Loans:** Users can deposit assets as collateral to borrow other tokens.
- **Interest Rates:** Dynamic rates based on supply and demand, calculated on-chain.
- **Governance:** Token holders can propose and vote on protocol upgrades.
- **Yield Farming:** Users can stake tokens to earn rewards.

## Security
- Audited by reputable third-party firms.
