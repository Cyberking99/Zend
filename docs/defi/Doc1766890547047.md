# ProjectName - Technical Documentation Overview

## Introduction
ProjectName is a decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol built on the Ethereum blockchain, designed to provide secure, transparent, and efficient financial services without intermediaries. It enables users to lend, borrow, and earn yield on crypto assets through smart contracts.

## Architecture
- **Blockchain:** Ethereum (EVM-compatible)
- **Smart Contracts:** Written in Solidity, deployed via Hardhat
- **Frontend:** React.js with Web3.js integration
- **Oracles:** Chainlink for off-chain data feeds
- **Storage:** IPFS for decentralized file storage

## Core Components
1. **Lending Pool Contract**  
   Handles deposits and withdrawals of assets, manages interest rates, and tracks user balances.

2. **Borrowing Contract**  
   Allows users to borrow assets against collateral, enforcing liquidation rules and collateralization ratios.

3. **Yield Farming Module**  
   Distributes governance tokens as rewards for liquidity providers, incentivizing participation.

4. **Governance Contract**  
   Enables token holders to propose and vote on protocol upgrades and parameter changes.

## Security
