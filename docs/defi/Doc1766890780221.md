# ProjectName - Technical Documentation Overview

## Introduction
ProjectName is a decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol built on the Ethereum blockchain that enables users to lend, borrow, and earn interest on crypto assets in a trustless and permissionless manner. Leveraging smart contracts, ProjectName eliminates intermediaries, reduces costs, and increases accessibility to financial services globally.

## Architecture

### Smart Contracts
- **Lending Pool Contract:** Manages deposits and withdrawals of assets. Users can supply tokens to earn interest.
- **Borrowing Contract:** Allows users to borrow assets against collateral with dynamically calculated interest rates.
- **Collateral Management:** Handles collateral deposits, liquidation triggers, and health factor calculations to ensure protocol solvency.
- **Interest Rate Model:** Implements algorithmic interest rates based on asset utilization to maintain liquidity balance.

### Token Standards
- Utilizes ERC-20 tokens for deposits and loans.
- Implements a native governance token (ERC-20) enabling community voting on protocol upgrades.

## Key Features
- **Overcollateralized Loans:** Ensures borrower solvency by requiring collateral exceeding loan value.
- **Flash Loans:** Provides uncollateralized, instantaneous loans that must be repaid within one transaction.
- **Yield Farming:** Incentivizes liquidity providers with additional token rewards.
- **Governance:** Decentralized decision-making through token-weighted voting.

## Security Considerations
- Contracts are audited by reputable third-party firms.
- Implements time-locked upgrades to prevent sudden changes.
