# ProjectName - Technical Documentation Overview

## Introduction
ProjectName is a decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol built on the Ethereum blockchain, designed to enable trustless lending, borrowing, and yield farming. By leveraging smart contracts, ProjectName removes intermediaries, providing users with transparent, secure, and efficient financial services.

## Architecture
- **Smart Contracts:** Written in Solidity, the core contracts manage lending pools, collateralization, interest rates, and governance.
- **Token Standards:** Utilizes ERC-20 for the native token and ERC-721 for unique collateral assets.
- **Oracles:** Integrates Chainlink oracles to fetch real-time asset prices ensuring accurate collateral valuation.
- **Front-end:** React-based DApp interacting with smart contracts via Web3.js or Ethers.js.

## Key Components
- **Lending Pool Contract:** Handles deposits, withdrawals, and interest accrual.
- **Collateral Management:** Users deposit supported assets as collateral to borrow other tokens.
- **Liquidation Mechanism:** Automatically liquidates under-collateralized positions to maintain protocol solvency.
- **Governance Module:** Token holders can propose and vote on protocol upgrades.

## Security
- Audited by third-party firms with emphasis on reentrancy, overflow/underflow, and oracle manipulation vulnerabilities.
- Implements multi-signature wallets for critical contract upgrades.

## Getting Started
1. Connect a Web3 wallet (e.g., MetaMask) to the ProjectName DApp.
2. Deposit
