# ProjectName - Technical Documentation Overview

**ProjectName** is a decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol built on the Ethereum blockchain, designed to enable trustless lending, borrowing, and yield farming with optimized gas efficiency and security.

## Key Components

- **Smart Contracts:**  
  - Written in Solidity, audited for security.  
  - Core contracts include LendingPool, Borrower, and YieldFarm modules.  
  - Implements ERC-20 token standards for native governance and reward tokens.

- **Protocol Features:**  
  - **Lending & Borrowing:** Users can deposit assets as collateral to borrow supported tokens.  
  - **Yield Farming:** Stake tokens to earn rewards with dynamic APY based on pool utilization.  
  - **Liquidation Mechanism:** Automated liquidation protects lenders by liquidating collateral when loan-to-value ratios exceed thresholds.

- **Governance:**  
  - Decentralized governance via a DAO using the native governance token.  
  - Proposals and voting are executed on-chain to upgrade protocol parameters or contracts.

## Architecture Overview

1. **Frontend:** React-based dApp interacting with smart contracts via Web3.js/Ethers.js.  
2. **Backend:** Off-chain services for indexing and analytics using The Graph protocol.  
3. **Smart Contracts:** Deployed on Ethereum mainnet and compatible Layer 2 solutions for scalability.

## Security Measures

- Multi-phase audits by third-party firms.  
- Bug bounty program incentivizing community reporting.
