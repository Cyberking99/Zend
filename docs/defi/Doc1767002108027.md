# ProjectName - Technical Documentation Overview

## Introduction
ProjectName is a decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol built on the Ethereum blockchain that enables users to lend, borrow, and earn interest on their crypto assets in a trustless and permissionless manner. Leveraging smart contracts, ProjectName eliminates intermediaries, reducing costs and increasing transparency.

### Smart Contracts
- **LendingPool:** Core contract managing deposits, withdrawals, and loans.
- **InterestRateModel:** Dynamically adjusts interest rates based on supply and demand.
- **TokenContracts:** ERC-20 compliant tokens representing user deposits (aTokens).
- **Oracle:** Provides real-time price feeds for collateral valuation.

### Frontend
- React-based web application interacting with smart contracts via Web3.js/Ethers.js.
- Wallet integration supporting MetaMask, WalletConnect, and Ledger.

### Backend
- Node.js services for indexing blockchain events and providing APIs for analytics.
- Integration with The Graph for efficient querying of on-chain data.

## Key Features

- **Interest Earning:** Depositors earn variable interest paid in real-time.
- **Flash Loans:** Instant, uncollateralized loans that must be repaid within one transaction.
- **Governance:** Token holders can propose and vote on protocol upgrades.
