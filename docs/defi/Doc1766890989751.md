# ProjectName - Technical Documentation Note

## Overview
ProjectName is a decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol built on the Ethereum blockchain, designed to enable seamless, trustless lending and borrowing of digital assets. By leveraging smart contracts, ProjectName removes intermediaries, reduces costs, and enhances transparency for users.

## Core Components
- **Smart Contracts:** Govern lending, borrowing, collateral management, and liquidation processes. Audited for security and deployed on Ethereum mainnet.
- **Governance Token (PN-T):** Allows holders to propose and vote on protocol upgrades and parameter changes.
- **Liquidity Pools:** Users can supply assets to liquidity pools to earn interest and facilitate borrowing.
- **Oracles:** Integrate decentralized price feeds to ensure accurate collateral valuation and liquidation triggers.

## Key Features
- **Overcollateralized Loans:** Users must deposit collateral exceeding the loan value to secure borrowing.
- **Interest Rate Model:** Dynamic interest rates based on supply and demand to optimize capital efficiency.
- **Liquidation Mechanism:** Automated liquidation of undercollateralized positions to protect lenders.
- **Permissionless Access:** Anyone with an Ethereum wallet can participate without intermediaries.

## Security and Audits
ProjectName’s smart contracts have undergone multiple third-party security audits to identify and mitigate vulnerabilities. Continuous monitoring and bug bounty programs are in place to maintain protocol integrity.

## Getting Started
- Connect your Ethereum wallet (e.g., MetaMask) to the ProjectName dApp.
- Deposit supported collateral assets
