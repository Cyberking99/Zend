# ProjectName - Decentralized Finance (DeFi) Protocol

## Overview
ProjectName is a decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol built on the Ethereum blockchain, designed to enable trustless, permissionless financial services including lending, borrowing, and yield farming. It leverages smart contracts to automate and secure transactions without intermediaries.

## Key Features
- **Lending & Borrowing:** Users can supply assets to earn interest or borrow assets by providing collateral.
- **Yield Farming:** Stake tokens in liquidity pools to earn rewards and maximize returns.
- **Governance:** Token holders participate in protocol decisions through a decentralized governance model.
- **Security:** Audited smart contracts with multi-layered security measures to protect user funds.

## Architecture
- **Smart Contracts:** Written in Solidity, deployed on Ethereum mainnet.
- **Frontend:** React-based web application interacting with smart contracts via Web3.js.
- **Oracles:** Integrates Chainlink oracles for reliable off-chain price feeds.
- **Liquidity Pools:** Automated Market Maker (AMM) model facilitating asset swaps and liquidity provision.
