# Project Name: DeFiX Protocol

## Overview
DeFiX Protocol is a decentralized finance (DeFi) platform built on the Ethereum blockchain. It enables users to lend, borrow, and trade digital assets in a trustless, permissionless environment. By leveraging smart contracts, DeFiX eliminates intermediaries, reduces costs, and increases transparency and security.

## Key Features
- **Lending & Borrowing:** Users can deposit assets to earn interest or borrow assets by providing collateral.
- **Automated Market Maker (AMM):** A built-in AMM facilitates decentralized token swaps with low slippage.
- **Yield Farming:** Users can stake liquidity provider (LP) tokens to earn additional rewards.
- **Governance:** Token holders can propose and vote on protocol upgrades and parameter changes.
- **Security:** Audited smart contracts with multi-layered security measures to protect user funds.

## Architecture
- **Smart Contracts:** Written in Solidity, deployed on Ethereum mainnet.
- **Frontend:** React-based web application interacting with contracts via Web3.js.
- **Oracles:** Integrates Chainlink oracles for real-time price feeds.
- **Wallet Support:** Compatible with MetaMask, WalletConnect, and other Ethereum wallets.

## Getting Started
1. Connect your Ethereum wallet to the DeFiX frontend.
2. Deposit supported tokens to start lending or provide liquidity.
3. Borrow assets by locking collateral above the required collateralization ratio.
4. Stake LP tokens in yield farming
