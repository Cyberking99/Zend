# ProjectName - Technical Documentation Overview

## Introduction
ProjectName is a decentralized finance (DeFi) platform built on the Ethereum blockchain, designed to provide users with seamless access to lending, borrowing, and yield farming services. Leveraging smart contracts, ProjectName enables trustless and permissionless financial interactions without intermediaries.

## Architecture
- **Smart Contracts:** Written in Solidity, deployed on Ethereum mainnet. Core contracts include:
  - **LendingPool:** Manages deposits, withdrawals, and interest accrual.
  - **BorrowerContract:** Handles loan issuance and repayment.
  - **YieldFarm:** Distributes rewards based on liquidity provision.
- **Frontend:** React-based web interface interacting with smart contracts via Web3.js.
- **Oracles:** Chainlink oracles provide real-time price feeds to ensure accurate collateral valuations.

## Key Features
- **Collateralized Loans:** Users can deposit supported assets as collateral to borrow stablecoins.
- **Interest Rates:** Dynamic interest rates determined algorithmically based on supply and demand.
- **Liquidity Mining:** Users earn governance tokens by providing liquidity.
- **Governance:** Token holders can propose and vote on protocol upgrades.

## Security
- Audited by third-party firms to ensure smart contract integrity.
- Implements reentrancy guards and input validation.
- Uses decentralized oracles to mitigate price manipulation risks.
