- **Automated Liquidations:** Smart contracts automatically liquidate undercollateralized positions to maintain system health.
- **Interest Rate Model:** Dynamic rates based on supply and demand.
- **Interoperability:** Supports multiple ERC-20 tokens and integrates with external DeFi protocols.

## Security
- Audited by reputable third-party firms.
- Implements upgradeable proxy patterns for seamless contract upgrades.
- Uses multi-signature wallets for administrative controls.

## Getting Started
- **Connect Wallet:** Compatible with MetaMask and other Web3 wallets.
- **Deposit Assets:** Supply supported tokens to earn interest.
