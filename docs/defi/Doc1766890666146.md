# ProjectName - Technical Documentation Overview

## Introduction
ProjectName is a decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol built on the Ethereum blockchain designed to provide users with secure, transparent, and permissionless financial services. It enables functionalities such as lending, borrowing, and yield farming through smart contracts without intermediaries.

## Architecture
- **Blockchain:** Ethereum (EVM-compatible)
- **Smart Contracts:** Written in Solidity, deployed via Truffle/Hardhat
- **Frontend:** React.js with Web3.js/Ethers.js integration
- **Oracles:** Chainlink for off-chain data feeds

## Core Components
1. **Lending Pool Contract:** Manages deposits and loans, calculates interest rates dynamically based on utilization.
2. **Token Contracts:** ERC-20 compliant tokens representing user deposits (aTokens).
3. **Yield Farming Module:** Allows users to stake tokens and earn rewards.
4. **Governance Contract:** Enables token holders to propose and vote on protocol upgrades.

## Security
- Audited by reputable firms (e.g., CertiK, OpenZeppelin)
- Implements reentrancy guards, input validation, and rate limiting
- Upgradable contracts via proxy pattern with multisig governance control

## Usage
- Users connect wallets (e.g., MetaMask) to interact with the dApp
- Deposit assets to earn interest or use collateral to borrow
- Stake governance tokens to participate in protocol decisions

## APIs & Integration
- RESTful API endpoints for off
