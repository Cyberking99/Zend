# ProjectName: Decentralized Finance (DeFi) Protocol

## Overview
ProjectName is a decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol built on the Ethereum blockchain that enables users to lend, borrow, and earn interest on digital assets without intermediaries. Utilizing smart contracts, ProjectName ensures transparent, secure, and permissionless financial services.

## Key Features
- **Lending & Borrowing:** Users can supply assets to liquidity pools to earn interest or borrow assets by providing collateral.
- **Interest Rates:** Dynamic interest rates are algorithmically adjusted based on supply and demand.
- **Collateralization:** Over-collateralization ensures loan security and minimizes default risk.
- **Governance:** Token holders can participate in protocol governance, proposing and voting on upgrades.
- **Security:** Audited smart contracts with multi-layer security measures to protect user funds.

## Architecture
- **Smart Contracts:** Written in Solidity, deployed on Ethereum mainnet.
- **Frontend:** React-based web application interacting with contracts via Web3.js.
- **Oracles:** Price feeds integrated through Chainlink to ensure accurate asset valuations.
- **Token:** ERC-20 governance token enabling voting and staking.

## Getting Started
1. Connect your Ethereum wallet (e.g., MetaMask) to the ProjectName frontend.
2. Deposit supported assets into the lending pool.
3. Borrow assets by locking collateral above the required threshold.
4. Monitor positions and manage collateral to avoid liquidation.

## Security Considerations
- Users must maintain
