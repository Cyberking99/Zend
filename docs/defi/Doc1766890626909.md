# ProjectName - Technical Documentation Overview

## Introduction
ProjectName is a decentralized finance (DeFi) platform built on the Ethereum blockchain designed to provide seamless, trustless financial services including lending, borrowing, and yield farming. It leverages smart contracts to enable secure and transparent interactions without intermediaries.

## Architecture
- **Blockchain:** Ethereum (EVM-compatible)
- **Smart Contracts:** Written in Solidity, deployed using Truffle framework
- **Frontend:** React.js with Web3.js for blockchain interaction
- **Oracles:** Chainlink for reliable off-chain data feeds

## Core Components
1. **Lending Pool Contract:** Manages user deposits and issues interest-bearing tokens.
2. **Borrowing Module:** Allows users to take loans against collateral with dynamic interest rates.
3. **Yield Farming Contract:** Enables staking of liquidity provider (LP) tokens to earn rewards.
4. **Governance Contract:** Implements token-based voting for protocol upgrades and parameter adjustments.

## Security Measures
- Multi-layered access control with role-based permissions
- Comprehensive unit and integration testing using Hardhat
- Audited by reputable third-party security firms
- Timelock mechanisms for contract upgrades to prevent sudden changes

## Usage
- Connect wallet (MetaMask, WalletConnect)
- Deposit supported assets into lending pools
- Borrow assets by providing collateral
- Stake tokens to participate in yield farming and governance

## Future Roadmap
- Cross-chain interoperability via layer-2 solutions
- Enhanced privacy
