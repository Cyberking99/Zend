# ProjectName: Decentralized Finance (DeFi) Protocol

## Overview
ProjectName is a decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol built on the Ethereum blockchain that enables users to lend, borrow, and earn interest on crypto assets without intermediaries. Utilizing smart contracts, ProjectName ensures trustless, transparent, and permissionless financial services.

## Key Features
- **Lending & Borrowing:** Users can supply assets to liquidity pools and earn interest or borrow assets by collateralizing their holdings.
- **Interest Rates:** Dynamic interest rates are algorithmically adjusted based on supply and demand.
- **Collateral Management:** Supports multiple ERC-20 tokens as collateral with real-time liquidation mechanisms to mitigate risk.
- **Governance:** Token holders participate in protocol upgrades and parameter adjustments through decentralized governance.
- **Security:** Smart contracts are audited and incorporate multi-signature controls and timelocks for critical functions.

## Architecture
- **Smart Contracts:** Written in Solidity, deployed on Ethereum mainnet.
- **Frontend:** React-based interface interacting with contracts via Web3.js/Ethers.js.
- **Oracles:** Price feeds integrated via Chainlink to ensure accurate asset valuations.

## Getting Started
1. Connect your Ethereum wallet (e.g., MetaMask).
2. Deposit supported collateral tokens.
3. Borrow assets or supply liquidity to earn interest.
4. Monitor your positions and governance proposals via the dashboard.
