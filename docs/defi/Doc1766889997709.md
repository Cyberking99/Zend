# ProjectName: Decentralized Finance (DeFi) Protocol

## Overview
ProjectName is a decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol built on the Ethereum blockchain designed to enable trustless lending, borrowing, and yield farming. It leverages smart contracts to automate financial operations without intermediaries, ensuring transparency, security, and composability within the DeFi ecosystem.

## Key Features
- **Lending & Borrowing:** Users can supply assets to earn interest or borrow assets by providing collateral.
- **Yield Farming:** Stake tokens in liquidity pools to earn rewards in the form of native governance tokens.
- **Collateral Management:** Supports multiple ERC-20 assets as collateral with dynamic collateralization ratios.
- **Governance:** Token holders can propose and vote on protocol upgrades and parameter changes.
- **Security:** Implements audited smart contracts with multi-signature admin controls and time-locked upgrades.

## Architecture
- **Smart Contracts:** Written in Solidity, deployed on Ethereum mainnet.
- **Oracle Integration:** Price feeds sourced from Chainlink oracles to ensure accurate asset valuations.
- **Frontend:** React-based web interface connected via Web3.js or Ethers.js.
- **Backend:** Optional off-chain services for analytics and notifications.

## Getting Started
1. Connect your Ethereum wallet (e.g., MetaMask) to the ProjectName frontend.
2. Deposit supported ERC-20 tokens to supply liquidity or use as collateral.
3. Borrow assets against your collateral or stake tokens to earn yield.
