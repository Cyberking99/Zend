# ProjectName: Decentralized Finance Protocol

## Overview
ProjectName is a decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol built on the Ethereum blockchain that enables users to lend, borrow, and earn interest on crypto assets without intermediaries. It leverages smart contracts to provide transparent, secure, and permissionless financial services.

## Key Features
- **Lending & Borrowing:** Users can supply assets to liquidity pools to earn interest or borrow assets by providing collateral.
- **Collateral Management:** Supports multiple ERC-20 tokens as collateral with real-time liquidation mechanisms to maintain protocol solvency.
- **Interest Rates:** Dynamic interest rates determined algorithmically based on supply and demand.
- **Governance:** Token holders can propose and vote on protocol upgrades and parameter changes via a decentralized governance model.
- **Security:** Audited smart contracts with multi-signature admin controls and bug bounty programs.

## Architecture
- **Smart Contracts:** Written in Solidity, deployed on Ethereum mainnet.
- **Frontend:** React-based web application interacting with contracts via Web3.js.
- **Oracles:** Integration with Chainlink for reliable price feeds.
- **IPFS:** Decentralized storage for off-chain metadata.

## Getting Started
1. Connect your Ethereum wallet (e.g., MetaMask) to the ProjectName frontend.
2. Deposit supported ERC-20 tokens into lending pools.
3. Borrow assets by locking collateral.
4. Monitor your positions and manage collateralization ratios.
5. Participate in governance by staking governance
