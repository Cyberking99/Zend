# ProjectName - Technical Documentation Overview

## Introduction
ProjectName is a decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol built on the Ethereum blockchain designed to provide users with secure, transparent, and permissionless financial services. The platform enables lending, borrowing, and yield farming through smart contracts, eliminating intermediaries and reducing costs.

## Architecture
- **Smart Contracts:** Written in Solidity, deployed on Ethereum mainnet. Core contracts include:
  - **LendingPool:** Manages deposits and loans.
  - **YieldFarm:** Handles staking and reward distribution.
  - **Governance:** Enables decentralized protocol upgrades via token-holder voting.
- **Frontend:** React-based web application interacting with smart contracts via Web3.js/Ethers.js.
- **Oracles:** Chainlink oracles provide real-time price feeds for collateral valuation.

## Key Features
- **Collateralized Loans:** Users can deposit supported assets as collateral to borrow other tokens.
- **Interest Rates:** Dynamic rates based on supply and demand, adjusted algorithmically.
- **Yield Farming:** Stake tokens to earn additional rewards in ProjectName governance tokens.
- **Governance:** Token holders propose and vote on protocol changes, ensuring decentralized control.

## Security
- Smart contracts undergo regular audits by third-party firms.
- Implements upgradeable proxy patterns for seamless contract improvements.
- Uses OpenZeppelin libraries for standardized, secure contract components.

## Getting Started
1. Connect a Web3 wallet (e.g., MetaMask) to the ProjectName frontend.
