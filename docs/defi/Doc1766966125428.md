# ProjectName - Technical Documentation Overview

## Introduction
ProjectName is a decentralized finance (DeFi) platform built on the Ethereum blockchain, designed to enable trustless, permissionless financial services. It provides users with tools for lending, borrowing, and yield farming through smart contracts, ensuring transparency and security without intermediaries.

## Architecture
- **Blockchain:** Ethereum Mainnet (EVM-compatible)
- **Smart Contracts:** Written in Solidity, audited for security
- **Frontend:** React.js with Web3.js integration
- **Backend:** Node.js API for off-chain data aggregation

## Core Components
1. **Lending Protocol:** Users can deposit assets to earn interest or borrow against collateral.
2. **Yield Farming:** Liquidity providers earn rewards by staking tokens in various pools.
3. **Governance:** Token holders participate in protocol upgrades via on-chain voting.
4. **Oracle Integration:** Price feeds are sourced from Chainlink to ensure accurate asset valuations.

## Security
- Multi-phase smart contract audits conducted by reputable firms.
- Use of OpenZeppelin libraries to follow best practices.
- Timelocks implemented for critical contract upgrades.

## Getting Started
- Connect a Web3 wallet (e.g., MetaMask) to the platform.
- Deposit supported ERC-20 tokens into the lending pool.
- Stake LP tokens in farming contracts to earn rewards.
- Participate in governance proposals using governance tokens.
