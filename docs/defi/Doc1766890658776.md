# ProjectName DeFi Protocol - Technical Overview

## Introduction
ProjectName is a decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol built on the Ethereum blockchain designed to provide secure, transparent, and permissionless financial services. It enables users to lend, borrow, and earn yield on their crypto assets without intermediaries.

## Architecture
- **Smart Contracts:** Written in Solidity, deployed on Ethereum mainnet. Core contracts include:
  - **LendingPool:** Manages deposits, loans, and interest calculations.
  - **Token:** ERC-20 compliant tokens representing user deposits and debt.
  - **Oracle:** Integrates with Chainlink oracles for real-time price feeds.
- **Frontend:** React-based dApp interacting with smart contracts via Web3.js/Ethers.js.
- **Backend:** Optional off-chain services for analytics and notifications.

## Key Features
- **Overcollateralized Loans:** Users can borrow assets by depositing collateral exceeding the loan value.
- **Interest Rates:** Dynamic interest rates based on supply and demand, calculated per block.
- **Liquidation Mechanism:** Positions below collateral thresholds are liquidated to maintain protocol solvency.
- **Governance:** Token holders can propose and vote on protocol upgrades.

## Security
- Audited by third-party firms.
- Implements reentrancy guards, safe math operations, and access controls.
- Uses decentralized oracles to prevent price manipulation.
