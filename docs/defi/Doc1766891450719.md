# ProjectName: Decentralized Finance (DeFi) Protocol

## Overview
ProjectName is a decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol built on the Ethereum blockchain that enables users to lend, borrow, and earn interest on crypto assets without intermediaries. Utilizing smart contracts, ProjectName ensures trustless, transparent, and secure financial interactions.

## Key Features
- **Lending & Borrowing:** Users can supply assets to liquidity pools and borrow against collateral at algorithmically determined interest rates.
- **Yield Farming:** Stake tokens to earn rewards and maximize returns.
- **Collateral Management:** Supports multiple ERC-20 tokens as collateral with real-time liquidation mechanisms to mitigate risks.
- **Governance:** Token holders can propose and vote on protocol upgrades and parameter changes via decentralized governance.

## Architecture
- **Smart Contracts:** Written in Solidity, audited for security, and deployed on Ethereum mainnet.
- **Oracle Integration:** Uses Chainlink oracles for reliable off-chain price feeds.
- **Frontend:** React-based web app interfacing with smart contracts via Web3.js or Ethers.js.
- **Backend:** Optional off-chain services for analytics and notifications.

## Security
- Comprehensive smart contract audits by third-party firms.
- Bug bounty program incentivizing community vulnerability reporting.
- Multi-signature wallets for contract upgrades and fund management.

## Getting Started
1. Connect your Ethereum wallet (e.g., MetaMask) to the ProjectName dApp.
2. Deposit supported tokens to supply liquidity or use as
