# ProjectName Technical Documentation - Overview

## Introduction
ProjectName is a decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol built on the Ethereum blockchain, designed to enable trustless lending, borrowing, and yield farming. Leveraging smart contracts, ProjectName facilitates secure and transparent financial interactions without intermediaries.

## Key Components

- **Smart Contracts:** Core contracts handle asset deposits, loan issuance, interest calculations, and liquidation processes. All contracts are audited and open-source.
- **Governance Token (PNM):** Token holders can propose and vote on protocol upgrades, fee structures, and parameter adjustments.
- **Liquidity Pools:** Users can provide liquidity to various asset pools and earn rewards through yield farming incentives.
- **Oracle Integration:** Real-time price feeds from decentralized oracles ensure accurate asset valuations and risk assessments.

## Architecture

- **Blockchain:** Ethereum Mainnet (compatible with EVM-based chains)
- **Languages:** Solidity for smart contracts, JavaScript/TypeScript for frontend and scripts
- **Frontend:** React-based web interface for user interactions
- **Backend:** Node.js services for off-chain computations and event monitoring

## Security

- Multi-layered security audits conducted by reputable firms
- Timelock mechanisms on governance proposals
- Emergency pause functionality to mitigate unforeseen vulnerabilities

## Getting Started

1. Connect your Ethereum wallet (e.g., MetaMask) to the ProjectName dApp.
2. Deposit supported assets into the lending pools.
3. Borrow assets against your collateral or provide liquidity
