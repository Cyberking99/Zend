# ProjectName - Technical Documentation Overview

## Introduction
ProjectName is a decentralized finance (DeFi) platform built on the Ethereum blockchain that enables users to lend, borrow, and earn yield on their crypto assets in a trustless and permissionless environment.

## Architecture
- **Smart Contracts:** Core logic is implemented via Solidity smart contracts deployed on Ethereum Mainnet.
- **Token Standards:** Utilizes ERC-20 tokens for asset representation and ERC-721 for unique collateral NFTs.
- **Oracles:** Integrates Chainlink oracles for reliable off-chain price feeds.
- **Frontend:** React-based web application interacting with smart contracts through Web3.js/Ethers.js.

## Key Components
- **Lending Pool:** Users can deposit supported tokens to earn interest.
- **Borrowing Module:** Allows users to borrow assets by providing collateral.
- **Liquidation Mechanism:** Automatically liquidates undercollateralized positions to maintain protocol solvency.
- **Governance:** Token holders can propose and vote on protocol upgrades via a DAO.

## Security
- Contracts are audited by reputable third-party firms.
- Implements reentrancy guards and follows best practices to prevent common vulnerabilities.
- Uses upgradeable proxy patterns to allow safe contract upgrades.

## Getting Started
- Connect your Ethereum wallet (e.g., MetaMask) to the platform.
- Deposit supported tokens into the lending pool.
- Borrow assets by locking collateral.
- Monitor positions and participate in governance through the dashboard.
