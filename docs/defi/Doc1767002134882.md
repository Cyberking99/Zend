# ProjectName - Technical Documentation Overview

## Introduction
ProjectName is a decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol built on the Ethereum blockchain that enables users to lend, borrow, and earn interest on cryptocurrency assets in a trustless and permissionless manner. The platform leverages smart contracts to automate financial operations, ensuring transparency, security, and efficiency without intermediaries.

## Architecture

### Smart Contracts
- **Lending Pool Contract:** Manages deposits and withdrawals of assets, tracks user balances, and calculates interest rates dynamically based on supply and demand.
- **Borrowing Contract:** Allows users to borrow assets by collateralizing their holdings. It enforces collateralization ratios and handles liquidation processes.
- **Interest Rate Model:** Implements an algorithmic model to adjust interest rates in real-time, optimizing liquidity and risk.
- **Governance Contract:** Enables token holders to propose and vote on protocol upgrades and parameter changes.

### Token Standards
- Utilizes ERC-20 tokens for representing user deposits and governance tokens.
- Supports wrapped tokens (e.g., WETH) for compatibility with various assets.

## Key Features
- **Overcollateralized Loans:** Ensures borrower positions are secured to mitigate default risk.
- **Automated Liquidations:** Smart contracts trigger liquidations when collateral falls below thresholds.
- **Yield Farming:** Users can stake tokens to earn additional rewards.
- **Cross-Chain Compatibility:** Planned integration with other blockchains via bridges for asset interoperability.

## Security Considerations
