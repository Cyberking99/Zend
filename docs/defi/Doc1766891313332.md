# ProjectName - Technical Documentation Overview

## Introduction
ProjectName is a decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol built on the Ethereum blockchain, designed to enable trustless, permissionless, and transparent financial services. It facilitates lending, borrowing, and yield farming through smart contracts without intermediaries.

## Architecture
- **Smart Contracts:** Written in Solidity, deployed on Ethereum mainnet.
- **Core Modules:**
  - **Lending Pool:** Users can supply assets to earn interest or borrow assets by providing collateral.
  - **Collateral Management:** Supports multiple ERC-20 tokens as collateral with dynamic collateralization ratios.
  - **Yield Farming:** Incentivizes liquidity providers with governance tokens.
- **Governance:** Token-based voting system allowing community-driven protocol upgrades.

## Key Features
- **Overcollateralized Loans:** Ensures loan security by requiring collateral exceeding loan value.
- **Interest Rate Model:** Utilizes an algorithmic model adjusting rates based on supply and demand.
- **Flash Loans:** Instant, uncollateralized loans repayable within one transaction block.
- **Security:** Audited smart contracts with multi-signature admin controls.

## Integration
- **Frontend:** React-based web interface interacting with smart contracts via Web3.js.
- **APIs:** RESTful endpoints for querying protocol data and user positions.
- **Wallet Support:** Compatible with MetaMask, WalletConnect, and other Ethereum wallets.

## Deployment
- **Networks:** Mainnet and testnets (Ropsten
