# ProjectName - Technical Overview

## Introduction
ProjectName is a decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol built on the Ethereum blockchain designed to enable trustless, permissionless financial services. It facilitates lending, borrowing, and yield farming through smart contracts, ensuring transparency and security without intermediaries.

## Architecture
- **Smart Contracts:** Written in Solidity, deployed on Ethereum mainnet. Core contracts include LendingPool, BorrowerRegistry, and YieldDistributor.
- **Oracle Integration:** Utilizes Chainlink oracles for real-time asset price feeds to maintain accurate collateral valuations.
- **Governance:** Token holders participate in protocol governance via a DAO, enabling proposals and voting on upgrades or parameter changes.

## Key Features
- **Lending & Borrowing:** Users can deposit supported assets to earn interest or borrow against collateral at algorithmically determined rates.
- **Collateral Management:** Supports multiple ERC-20 tokens as collateral with liquidation mechanisms to maintain protocol solvency.
- **Yield Farming:** Incentivizes liquidity provision with native token rewards distributed proportionally based on user stake.

## Security
- Audited by reputable third-party firms.
- Implements reentrancy guards and input validation to prevent common vulnerabilities.
- Continuous monitoring and bug bounty programs to enhance resilience.

## Getting Started
1. Connect a Web3 wallet (e.g., MetaMask) to the ProjectName dApp.
2. Deposit supported tokens to start earning interest or use as collateral.
3. Participate in governance by staking governance tokens and voting on
