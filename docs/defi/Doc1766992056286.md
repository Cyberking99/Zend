# ProjectName: Decentralized Finance (DeFi) Protocol

## Overview
ProjectName is a decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol built on the Ethereum blockchain that enables users to lend, borrow, and earn interest on crypto assets without intermediaries. Utilizing smart contracts, the platform ensures secure, transparent, and permissionless financial services.

## Key Features
- **Lending & Borrowing:** Users can deposit supported tokens to earn interest or borrow assets by providing collateral.
- **Interest Rates:** Dynamic interest rates are algorithmically adjusted based on supply and demand.
- **Collateral Management:** Supports multiple ERC-20 tokens as collateral with real-time liquidation to mitigate risk.
- **Governance:** Token holders can propose and vote on protocol upgrades and parameter changes.
- **Security:** Audited smart contracts with multi-signature admin controls and bug bounty programs.

## Architecture
- **Smart Contracts:** Written in Solidity, deployed on Ethereum mainnet.
- **Frontend:** React-based web application interacting with contracts via Web3.js.
- **Oracles:** Price feeds sourced from Chainlink to ensure accurate collateral valuation.
- **Storage:** On-chain data storage for balances, loans, and governance records.

## Getting Started
1. Connect your Ethereum wallet (e.g., MetaMask).
2. Deposit supported tokens into the lending pool.
3. Borrow assets by locking collateral.
4. Monitor your positions and repay loans to unlock collateral.

## Security Considerations
- Always verify contract addresses.
- Use hardware
