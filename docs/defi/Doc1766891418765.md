# ProjectName - Technical Documentation Overview

## Introduction
ProjectName is a decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol built on the Ethereum blockchain that enables users to lend, borrow, and earn interest on crypto assets in a trustless and permissionless manner. The protocol leverages smart contracts to automate financial operations, ensuring transparency, security, and composability within the DeFi ecosystem.

## Architecture

### Smart Contracts
- **Lending Pool Contract:** Manages deposits and withdrawals of assets, tracks user balances, and calculates interest accrual.
- **Borrowing Contract:** Allows users to take collateralized loans, enforcing liquidation conditions to maintain protocol solvency.
- **Interest Rate Model:** Dynamic algorithm adjusts interest rates based on supply and demand metrics.
- **Governance Contract:** Enables token holders to propose and vote on protocol upgrades.

### Token Standards
- Utilizes ERC-20 tokens for liquidity provision and governance.
- Implements ERC-721 for unique collateralized debt positions (optional).

## Key Features
- **Overcollateralized Loans:** Users must deposit assets exceeding loan value to mitigate default risk.
- **Interest Accrual:** Interest is compounded in real-time and reflected in user balances.
- **Liquidation Mechanism:** Automatically sells collateral when loan-to-value ratio exceeds a threshold.
- **Cross-Protocol Integration:** Compatible with major DeFi protocols for enhanced liquidity and composability.

## Security
- Smart contracts are audited by third-party firms.
- Implements role-based access control and timel
