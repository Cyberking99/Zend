# ProjectName - Technical Documentation Overview

## Introduction
ProjectName is a decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol built on the Ethereum blockchain designed to enable trustless, permissionless financial services. It facilitates lending, borrowing, and yield farming through smart contracts, providing users with secure and transparent access to liquidity.

## Architecture
- **Smart Contracts:** Written in Solidity, deployed on Ethereum mainnet.
- **Core Modules:**
  - **Lending Pool:** Manages deposits and loans, calculates interest rates algorithmically.
  - **Yield Farming:** Allows users to stake tokens and earn rewards.
  - **Governance:** Token-based voting system for protocol upgrades.
- **Oracles:** Integrates Chainlink oracles for reliable price feeds.

## Key Features
- **Overcollateralized Loans:** Ensures loan security by requiring collateral exceeding loan value.
- **Interest Rate Model:** Dynamic rates based on supply and demand.
- **Liquidation Mechanism:** Automatically liquidates undercollateralized positions to maintain protocol solvency.
- **Token Incentives:** Native governance token distributed as rewards.

## Security
- Audited by third-party firms.
- Implements reentrancy guards and strict access controls.
- Regular bug bounty programs.

## Getting Started
- Connect a Web3 wallet (e.g., MetaMask).
- Deposit supported collateral tokens.
- Borrow assets or stake tokens to earn yields.
- Participate in governance via the native token.
