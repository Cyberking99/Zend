# ProjectName - Technical Documentation Overview

## Introduction
ProjectName is a decentralized finance (DeFi) platform built on the Ethereum blockchain designed to provide secure, transparent, and permissionless financial services. It enables users to lend, borrow, and earn yield on their crypto assets without intermediaries.

## Architecture
- **Smart Contracts:** Written in Solidity, deployed on Ethereum mainnet. Core contracts include:
  - **LendingPool:** Manages deposits, loans, and interest calculations.
  - **Governance:** Allows token holders to propose and vote on protocol upgrades.
  - **Oracle:** Integrates with Chainlink to fetch real-time price feeds.
- **Frontend:** React-based web application interacting with smart contracts via Web3.js.
- **Backend:** Node.js services for indexing blockchain events and analytics.

## Key Features
- **Overcollateralized Loans:** Users can borrow assets by locking collateral exceeding the loan value.
- **Yield Farming:** Stake tokens to earn rewards distributed from protocol fees.
- **Governance Token:** Enables decentralized decision-making and incentivizes participation.
- **Flash Loans:** Instant, uncollateralized loans that must be repaid within one transaction.

## Security
- Audited by third-party firms (AuditFirm1, AuditFirm2).
- Implements OpenZeppelin’s secure contract libraries.
- Uses multi-signature wallets for admin operations.
