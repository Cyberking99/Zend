# ProjectName - Decentralized Finance (DeFi) Protocol

## Overview
ProjectName is a decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol built on the Ethereum blockchain that enables users to lend, borrow, and earn interest on crypto assets in a trustless and permissionless manner. Utilizing smart contracts, ProjectName removes intermediaries, reducing costs and increasing transparency.

## Key Features
- **Lending & Borrowing:** Users can deposit supported ERC-20 tokens to earn interest or borrow assets by providing collateral.
- **Interest Rates:** Dynamic interest rates are algorithmically adjusted based on supply and demand.
- **Collateral Management:** Supports over-collateralized loans to mitigate default risk.
- **Governance:** Token holders can propose and vote on protocol upgrades and parameter changes.
- **Security:** Audited smart contracts with multi-layered security measures to protect user funds.

## Architecture
- **Smart Contracts:** Written in Solidity, deployed on Ethereum mainnet.
- **Frontend:** React-based web interface for user interactions.
- **Oracles:** Integrates Chainlink oracles for real-time price feeds.
- **Governance Token:** ERC-20 token used for voting and protocol incentives.

## Getting Started
1. Connect a Web3 wallet (e.g., MetaMask) to the ProjectName frontend.
2. Deposit supported tokens into the lending pool.
3. Borrow assets by locking collateral above the required threshold.
4. Monitor loans and repay to reclaim collateral.
5. Participate in governance by
