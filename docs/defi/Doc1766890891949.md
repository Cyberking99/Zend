# ProjectName: Decentralized Finance (DeFi) Protocol

## Overview
ProjectName is a decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol built on the Ethereum blockchain, enabling users to lend, borrow, and earn interest on crypto assets without intermediaries. The platform leverages smart contracts to automate financial operations, ensuring transparency, security, and trustlessness.

## Key Features
- **Lending & Borrowing:** Users can supply assets to liquidity pools to earn interest or borrow assets by providing collateral.
- **Collateral Management:** Supports multiple ERC-20 tokens as collateral with dynamic collateralization ratios to manage liquidation risks.
- **Interest Rates:** Utilizes algorithmic interest rate models that adjust based on supply and demand.
- **Governance:** Token holders can propose and vote on protocol upgrades and parameter changes.
- **Security:** Audited smart contracts with multi-layered security measures to protect user funds.

## Architecture
- **Smart Contracts:** Written in Solidity, deployed on Ethereum mainnet.
- **Frontend:** React-based web application interacting with contracts via Web3.js.
- **Oracles:** Integrates Chainlink oracles for reliable price feeds.
- **IPFS:** Decentralized storage for off-chain data such as governance proposals.

## Getting Started
1. Connect your Ethereum wallet (e.g., MetaMask) to the ProjectName web app.
2. Deposit supported tokens to supply liquidity or use as collateral.
3. Borrow assets against your collateral or stake tokens to earn rewards.
