# ProjectName - Technical Overview

**ProjectName** is a decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol built on the Ethereum blockchain that enables users to lend, borrow, and earn interest on crypto assets in a trustless and permissionless manner.

## Key Components

- **Smart Contracts:**  
  Core logic is implemented via audited Solidity smart contracts, managing deposits, loans, interest calculations, and liquidations.

- **Lending & Borrowing:**  
  Users can supply supported ERC-20 tokens as collateral to borrow other assets. Collateralization ratios and interest rates are algorithmically determined based on supply and demand.

- **Interest Rates:**  
  Dynamic interest rates utilize an automated market maker (AMM) model to incentivize liquidity and maintain protocol solvency.

- **Liquidation Mechanism:**  
  Positions falling below the minimum collateralization threshold are subject to liquidation by third-party liquidators, ensuring system stability.

- **Governance:**  
  Token holders participate in protocol governance through on-chain voting to propose and approve upgrades, parameter changes, and new asset listings.

## Security

- Contracts have undergone multiple third-party audits.  
- Bug bounty program incentivizes responsible vulnerability disclosure.  
- Use of upgradeable proxy patterns allows safe contract upgrades.

## Integration

- Compatible with popular wallets (MetaMask, WalletConnect).  
- Supports integration with DeFi aggregators and analytics platforms via standard APIs.
