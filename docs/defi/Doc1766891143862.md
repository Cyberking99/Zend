# ProjectName - Technical Documentation Overview

## Introduction
ProjectName is a decentralized finance (DeFi) platform built on the Ethereum blockchain that enables users to lend, borrow, and earn yield on their crypto assets in a trustless and permissionless manner. The protocol leverages smart contracts to automate financial operations without intermediaries, ensuring transparency, security, and composability within the DeFi ecosystem.

## Architecture

### Smart Contracts
- **Lending Pool Contract:** Manages deposits and withdrawals, tracks user balances, and calculates interest rates dynamically based on supply and demand.
- **Borrowing Contract:** Allows users to take out loans by collateralizing their assets, enforcing collateralization ratios and liquidation mechanisms.
- **Yield Farming Contract:** Distributes native governance tokens as rewards to liquidity providers and stakers.
- **Oracle Integration:** Fetches real-time price feeds from decentralized oracles (e.g., Chainlink) to maintain accurate collateral valuations.

### Token Standards
- Utilizes ERC-20 for fungible tokens representing deposits and governance tokens.
- Implements ERC-721/ERC-1155 standards for unique collateralized assets or NFTs where applicable.

## Key Features
- **Overcollateralized Loans:** Users can borrow up to a certain percentage of their collateral value, minimizing default risk.
- **Dynamic Interest Rates:** Interest rates adjust algorithmically based on utilization rates of the lending pools.
- **Liquidation Mechanism:** Positions falling below collateral thresholds are liquidated to protect lenders.
- **Governance
