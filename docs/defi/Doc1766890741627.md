# ProjectName - Technical Documentation Overview

## Introduction
ProjectName is a decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol built on the Ethereum blockchain that enables users to lend, borrow, and earn interest on their crypto assets in a trustless and permissionless manner. Leveraging smart contracts, ProjectName eliminates intermediaries, reducing costs and increasing transparency.

## Architecture
- **Smart Contracts:** Written in Solidity, deployed on Ethereum mainnet. Core contracts include:
  - **LendingPool:** Manages deposits, withdrawals, and loan issuance.
  - **InterestRateModel:** Dynamically adjusts interest rates based on supply and demand.
  - **Token:** ERC-20 compliant token representing user deposits (aTokens).
- **Frontend:** React-based web application interacting with smart contracts via Web3.js/Ethers.js.
- **Oracles:** Price feeds integrated through Chainlink to ensure accurate asset valuations.

## Key Features
- **Collateralized Borrowing:** Users can deposit supported assets as collateral to borrow other tokens.
- **Interest Earning:** Depositors receive aTokens that accrue interest in real-time.
- **Liquidation Mechanism:** Positions falling below collateralization thresholds are liquidated to protect protocol solvency.
- **Governance:** Token holders can propose and vote on protocol upgrades.

## Security
- Contracts have undergone multiple third-party audits.
- Implements reentrancy guards and follows best practices to mitigate common vulnerabilities.
- Uses OpenZeppelin libraries for standard implementations.
