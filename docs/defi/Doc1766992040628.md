# Project Name: DeFiX Protocol

## Overview
DeFiX Protocol is a decentralized finance (DeFi) platform built on the Ethereum blockchain that enables users to lend, borrow, and earn interest on crypto assets in a trustless and permissionless environment. By leveraging smart contracts, DeFiX eliminates intermediaries, reduces costs, and increases transparency in financial transactions.

## Key Features
- **Lending & Borrowing:** Users can supply assets to liquidity pools and earn interest or borrow assets by providing collateral.
- **Collateral Management:** Supports multiple ERC-20 tokens as collateral with real-time liquidation mechanisms to maintain system solvency.
- **Interest Rate Model:** Dynamic interest rates based on supply and demand to incentivize market equilibrium.
- **Governance:** Token holders can propose and vote on protocol upgrades and parameter changes via a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO).
- **Security:** Audited smart contracts with multi-sig admin controls and continuous monitoring.

## Architecture
- **Smart Contracts:** Written in Solidity, deployed on Ethereum mainnet.
- **Frontend:** React-based web application interacting with smart contracts via Web3.js.
- **Oracles:** Integration with Chainlink for reliable off-chain data feeds.
- **IPFS:** Decentralized storage for governance proposals and documentation.

## Getting Started
1. Connect your Ethereum wallet (e.g., MetaMask) to the DeFiX dApp.
2. Deposit supported tokens into the lending pool.
3. Borrow assets by locking collateral above
