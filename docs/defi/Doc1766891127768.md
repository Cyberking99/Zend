# ProjectName - Technical Documentation Note

## Overview
ProjectName is a decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol built on the Ethereum blockchain designed to enable trustless, permissionless financial services. It facilitates lending, borrowing, and yield farming through smart contracts, eliminating intermediaries and enhancing transparency.

## Core Components
- **Smart Contracts:** Written in Solidity, these contracts manage user deposits, loans, collateralization, and interest rate calculations.
- **Governance Token (PNToken):** Enables holders to participate in protocol governance, including voting on proposals and parameter changes.
- **Liquidity Pools:** Users can provide liquidity to earn fees and rewards, supporting the platform’s lending and borrowing activities.
- **Oracle Integration:** Price feeds are sourced from decentralized oracles to ensure accurate asset valuations for collateral management.

## Key Features
- **Overcollateralized Loans:** Users can borrow assets by locking collateral exceeding the loan value to mitigate default risk.
- **Interest Rate Model:** Dynamic interest rates adjust based on supply and demand, optimizing capital efficiency.
- **Flash Loans:** Instant, uncollateralized loans that must be repaid within a single transaction, enabling arbitrage and liquidation strategies.
- **Security Audits:** Contracts have undergone multiple third-party audits to ensure robustness and minimize vulnerabilities.

## Getting Started
1. Connect a Web3 wallet (e.g., MetaMask) to the ProjectName dApp.
2. Deposit supported assets into the protocol to start earning interest or use as collateral.
3.
