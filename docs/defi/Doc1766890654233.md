# ProjectName - Technical Documentation Overview

## Introduction
ProjectName is a decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol built on the Ethereum blockchain that enables users to lend, borrow, and earn interest on crypto assets in a trustless and permissionless manner. Leveraging smart contracts, ProjectName eliminates intermediaries, ensuring transparency, security, and efficiency.

## Core Components

### 1. Smart Contracts
- **Lending Pool Contract**: Manages deposits and withdrawals of assets, tracks user balances, and calculates interest rates dynamically based on supply and demand.
- **Borrowing Contract**: Allows users to collateralize their assets to borrow other tokens, enforcing liquidation rules if collateral value falls below a threshold.
- **Governance Contract**: Enables token holders to propose and vote on protocol upgrades and parameter changes.

### 2. Interest Rate Model
ProjectName uses an algorithmic interest rate model that adjusts borrowing and lending rates in real-time based on asset utilization rates, promoting optimal liquidity.

### 3. Collateral Management
Supports multiple ERC-20 tokens as collateral. The protocol enforces over-collateralization and performs automatic liquidations via auctions when collateral value depreciates beyond safety margins.

### 4. Security Features
- **Audited Smart Contracts**: Contracts have undergone third-party security audits.
- **Timelocks**: Governance actions are delayed to allow community review.
- **Upgradability**: Modular contract design allows for safe upgrades via governance.
