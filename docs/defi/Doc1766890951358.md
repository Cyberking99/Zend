# DeFiX Protocol - Technical Overview

## Introduction
DeFiX is a decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol built on the Ethereum blockchain, enabling trustless lending, borrowing, and yield farming. It leverages smart contracts to automate financial operations without intermediaries, ensuring transparency, security, and composability within the DeFi ecosystem.

## Architecture

### Smart Contracts
- **LendingPool**: Manages deposits and loans, tracking user balances and collateral.
- **InterestModel**: Dynamically calculates interest rates based on supply and demand.
- **YieldFarm**: Distributes rewards to liquidity providers proportional to their contribution.
- **Governance**: Facilitates community voting on protocol upgrades and parameter changes.

### Token Standards
- **dXToken (ERC-20)**: Represents user deposits and can be transferred or used as collateral.
- **xYIELD (ERC-20)**: Reward token distributed to liquidity providers.

## Key Features
- **Overcollateralized Loans**: Users can borrow assets by locking collateral above a minimum threshold.
- **Flash Loans**: Instant, uncollateralized loans that must be repaid within one transaction.
- **Yield Farming**: Incentivizes liquidity provision with xYIELD rewards.
- **Governance**: Token holders participate in protocol decisions via on-chain voting.

## Security
- Contracts are audited by third-party firms.
- Implements reentrancy guards and safe math operations.
- Uses OpenZeppelin libraries
