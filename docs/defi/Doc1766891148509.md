# ProjectName - Technical Documentation

## Overview
ProjectName is a decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol built on the Ethereum blockchain, designed to enable trustless lending, borrowing, and yield farming. It leverages smart contracts to automate financial operations without intermediaries, ensuring transparency, security, and composability within the DeFi ecosystem.

## Key Components

- **Smart Contracts:**  
  Written in Solidity, the core contracts manage lending pools, collateralization, interest rates, and liquidation mechanisms. Contracts are audited and deployed on Ethereum mainnet.

- **Lending & Borrowing:**  
  Users can deposit supported ERC-20 tokens as collateral to borrow other assets. The protocol enforces over-collateralization to mitigate default risk.

- **Yield Farming:**  
  Liquidity providers earn rewards by staking tokens in various pools. Rewards are distributed via the native governance token.

- **Governance:**  
  Token holders participate in protocol governance through on-chain voting, enabling decentralized decision-making on upgrades and parameter changes.

## Architecture

- **Frontend:**  
  React-based web interface for user interactions with wallet integrations (e.g., MetaMask).

- **Backend:**  
  Off-chain services include indexing and analytics APIs to track protocol data and user positions.

- **Security:**  
  Multiple audits and bug bounty programs ensure contract robustness. Key functions include pause mechanisms and upgradeable proxies.

## Integration

- **Supported Networks:** Ethereum Mainnet, with plans for Polygon and Binance Smart Chain.
