# ProjectName - Technical Documentation Overview

## Introduction
ProjectName is a decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol built on the Ethereum blockchain, designed to enable trustless, permissionless financial services including lending, borrowing, and yield farming. The protocol leverages smart contracts to automate and secure transactions without intermediaries.

## Architecture
- **Smart Contracts:** Written in Solidity, deployed on Ethereum mainnet. Core contracts include:
  - **LendingPool:** Manages deposits, loans, and interest accrual.
  - **Token:** ERC-20 compliant governance and reward tokens.
  - **Oracle:** Provides real-time price feeds for collateral valuation.
- **Frontend:** React-based dApp interacting with smart contracts via Web3.js/Ethers.js.
- **Backend:** Optional off-chain services for analytics and notifications.

## Key Features
- **Overcollateralized Loans:** Users can deposit supported assets as collateral to borrow other tokens.
- **Interest Rates:** Dynamic rates determined algorithmically based on supply and demand.
- **Yield Farming:** Users earn rewards by providing liquidity or staking governance tokens.
- **Governance:** Token holders can propose and vote on protocol upgrades.

## Security
- Audited by reputable third-party firms.
- Implements reentrancy guards, input validation, and access control.
- Uses decentralized oracles to mitigate price manipulation risks.

## Getting Started
1. Connect your Ethereum wallet (e.g., MetaMask) to the dApp.
2. Deposit supported collateral assets into
