# ProjectName - Technical Documentation Overview

## Introduction
ProjectName is a decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol built on the Ethereum blockchain designed to enable trustless lending, borrowing, and yield farming. It leverages smart contracts to automate financial agreements without intermediaries, ensuring transparency, security, and accessibility.

## Architecture
- **Smart Contracts:** Written in Solidity, deployed on Ethereum mainnet. Core contracts include:
  - **LendingPool:** Manages deposits, withdrawals, and interest accrual.
  - **Borrower:** Handles collateral locking and loan issuance.
  - **YieldFarm:** Distributes rewards based on liquidity provision.
- **Oracle Integration:** Utilizes Chainlink oracles for real-time price feeds to ensure accurate collateral valuation.
- **Frontend:** React-based dApp interfacing with smart contracts via Web3.js or Ethers.js.

## Key Features
- **Overcollateralized Loans:** Users deposit crypto assets as collateral to borrow stablecoins.
- **Interest Rates:** Dynamic rates determined algorithmically based on supply and demand.
- **Liquidation Mechanism:** Automated liquidation of undercollateralized positions to maintain protocol solvency.
- **Governance:** Token holders can propose and vote on protocol upgrades.

## Security Considerations
- Conducted multiple audits by reputable firms.
- Implements reentrancy guards and input validation.
- Uses upgradeable proxy patterns for contract maintainability.

## Getting Started
1. Connect your Ethereum wallet (e.g., MetaMask) to
